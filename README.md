Virtual Pet Project



VIRTUAL PET PROJECT

Purpose:

1. The purpose of this project is to create a virtual pet in Microsoft Visual Studio using C#. There is a set of minimum criteria to be met, that is located in the WeCanCodeIT github account.
2. A real-world analogy that this project is a replica of could be the Tomagotchi. We are looking to create a pet program that can interact with users and respond to user input.

Goals:

1. I will create Barry the Blowfish
2. I will give Barry the Blowfish properties and methods
3. I will use the simplest, cleanest code possible
4. Upon completion, I will explain and/or upload my code into the ReadMe for the reader of this document to follow along the program lifecycle
